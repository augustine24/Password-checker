When you go into your bank account, email, college website or even a website like youtube, you need a password to protect your information. This repository is a password validity checker. That means it confirms rather a password can be created or not, at the password creation stage. If a password is valid, a message will be shown that confirms so. If not, there will be messages showing why the password could not be created. It's a feature that's used globally every day. 
By pasting the code into https://www.online-python.com/online_python_compiler you can run it(the run code button looks like a play button) and see how the system works. Alternatively a resource like Visual Studio Code can be used for this process, if its on your PC. I hope you enjoy using this!
